## TLDR - Get the app running

1. Fork this repo
2. Ensure you are running on node v20+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))
3. To install packages run: 
```bash
yarn
```
4. To start the application in development mode:
```bash
yarn dev
```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
6. Login in with user and pass: `john@example.com`

Alternatively, to start the application in production mode:
```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Getting Started

First, install the full and development package dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Next to start up the development server, simply run

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To run in production mode, first you will need to run a next build, via:

```bash
yarn build
```

Then to start the production server, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

You can log in to the application using the same email and password: `john@example.com` - in the future these will be encrypted and stored in a database.

## Tests

This repo uses Jest for unit testing, and Cypress for functional testing.

### Unit tests

You can run jest tests via:

```bash
yarn test
```

You can enable watch mode via:

```bash
yarn test --watch
```

You can also gather coverage via:

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

### linting

Linting can be ran manually via

```bash
yarn lint
```

It is also ran when performing a `$ yarn build`

Commitlint is also setup via husky that applies certain rules when comming, e.g. ensuring you have a commit message, and also ensuring the linter is ran on commit. 

Linting checks typescript also.

### Functional tests

This app supports functional testing via Cypress, this can be ran in window mode via

```bash
yarn cy:open
```

In the future we will add aat checks and the ability to run in headless mode. Also potentially plugins for visual regression checks.

### NextJS bundle analyser

The Next.js bundle analyzer helps visualise the size of your JavaScript bundles, allowing you to optimize and reduce the size of your app's build for better performance.

This can be ran via:

```bash
yarn analyse
```

Once complete, it will automaatically open the visualation dashboard in your browser.

## Usage

### User Interface

To view the UI endpoint navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

When you first navigate to the UI, you will need to log in, currently we only support log in for one user, `john@example.com` (user/pass). In the future this will change once we introduce a database, and then hook up with "real-ish" persisting data. 

When logged in the home page displays several options to navigate to, each displaying different core and interseting concepts of UI design and development using React, Typescript, NextJs and Material UI. You can also interact with the side menu at the top left for quick navigation. To log out, you can click the user icon at the top right of the header, and then click the `Log out` button.

### GraphQL

To view the GraphQL endpoint navigate to [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql)

This is only available in development mode. In production mode introspection has been disabled. You can still navigate to the page via the URL but you would be able to view the sandbox area like you would in development.

## Core concepts

### Server side sendering (SSR)

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering web pages on the server instead of the browser. The HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client fully rendered, allowing for faster initial page loads. Its worth noting that it may look the part, but it is not interactive when it is sent, React performs "hydration" which effectively means it boots up, applying relevant stylings and interactability to the user interface.

Benefits:

* **Faster initial load**: Students can access their dashboard and schedules quicker, even on slower connections.
* **SEO-friendly**: Important for any public pages (like university events) that might need to be indexed by search engines.
* **Improved performance**: Helps load pages with complex data like class schedules, assignments, etc. faster.

Downsides:

* **Increased server load**: Rendering on the server can be resource-intensive, especially with a large number of concurrent users (like during exam periods).
* **Complexity**: Implementing SSR requires more setup and handling compared to client-side rendering (CSR), which might lead to increased development time.
* **Longer server response times**: Since the server must fully render pages before sending them, this could slow down response times for certain interactions.

Examples:

-  [Enrolment Page](src/app/enrolment/page.tsx)
-  [Health Page](src/app/health/page.tsx)

### Hydration

Hydration is the process where a server-rendered HTML page becomes interactive when React "hydrates" it on the client side. This allows the page to load quickly with pre-rendered content before React takes over for interactivity.

Benefits:
* **Faster initial load:** Users see content immediately, making the app feel faster, which is crucial for students accessing their schedules or tasks quickly.
* **SEO-friendly**: Server-rendered content is better indexed by search engines, useful for public pages like university events.
* **Improved user experience**: Content is visible while React hydrates the page in the background, creating a smoother experience.
* **Seamless transition**: Hydration ensures a smooth handover from SSR (server-side rendering) to CSR (client-side rendering), keeping the app functional and interactive.

Downsides:

**Increased complexity**:

Managing hydration can complicate debugging and requires careful coordination between server and client rendering.
* **Performance delays**: Large apps may experience slow hydration, delaying interactivity for students trying to quickly manage tasks or schedules.
* **Hydration mismatch**: Mismatched content between server and client can lead to errors or unexpected behavior, affecting user experience.
* **Delayed interactivity**: Until hydration completes, the page may look loaded but won't respond to input, frustrating users.
* **JavaScript dependence**: Full interactivity still requires JavaScript, so users on slow connections or older devices may experience delays despite server rendering.

Examples:
- [ProgramsComponent](src/components/Programs/Programs.tsx)

### Suspense

Suspense is a React feature that allows developers to "suspend" the rendering of components until some data or resource is ready. This is useful for handling asynchronous tasks like data fetching.

Benefits:

* **Smooth user experience**: Loading states are better handled, making it more user-friendly while data like task lists or university timetables are being fetched.
* **Better user feedback**: Students can see clear indicators (e.g. loading spinners) while their information is fetched from the server.

Downsides:

* **Limited compatibility**: Suspense is still evolving, especially in handling server-side data fetching, meaning not all use cases are well-supported yet.
* **Complex error handling**: Managing errors when data fetching fails can become more complex when using Suspense, potentially leading to user frustration.
* **Async components complexity**: Coordinating multiple async components can make debugging and maintaining the app more difficult.

Examples:

- [UserProfile](src/components/UserProfile/UserProfile.tsx)

### Dynamic loading

Dynamic loading allows certain components or features of an application to be loaded only when they are needed, rather than loading everything upfront.

Benefits:

* **Faster initial page load**: Essential for students who need quick access to their schedule or task list without unnecessary features being loaded.
* **Reduced resource usage**: Helps save bandwidth and improve performance by loading content like detailed course information only when needed.

Downsides:

* **Delayed interaction**: Some components or features might not be available immediately, which can frustrate users if key information (like a class schedule) loads more slowly than expected.
* **Flickering UI**: If not implemented smoothly, dynamic loading can cause flickering or visible delays in rendering parts of the page, negatively impacting the user experience.
* **SEO issues**: Content that loads dynamically may not be indexed properly by search engines, affecting discoverability.

Examples:

- [Header Component](src/components/Header/Header.tsx)

### Code splitting

Code splitting involves breaking down an application into smaller chunks so that only the necessary parts of the code are loaded for any given page or component.

Benefits:

* **Improved performance**: Enhances the speed of the app, allowing students to access specific parts (like assignment tracking or messaging) without waiting for the entire application to load.
* **Better resource management**: Reduces the size of JavaScript bundles, which is particularly beneficial for mobile users.

Downsides:

* **Increased complexity**: Managing code-split bundles can add complexity to the development process, and improper use might lead to difficult debugging and performance issues.
* **Initial configuration**: Ensuring the app is properly optimized with code splitting requires careful setup and might lead to overhead for developers, especially for beginners.
* **Additional HTTP requests**: Code splitting can lead to more network requests (for each split file), which could affect performance if not managed properly.

Examples:
- [CampusPage](src/app/campus/page.tsx) - bundle only loaded when needed, useful as we dont need to load the images until they are needed.


### JSON Web Token (JWT)

JWT is a secure way to handle authentication and authorization. It allows the server to issue a token upon login, which is then stored on the client and sent with each subsequent request to verify the user.

Benefits:

* **Secure authentication**: Ensures that studentsâ€™ personal data and academic information are protected.
* **Stateless sessions**: Reduces server load since the server doesnâ€™t need to store session information, making the app faster and more scalable.
* **Persistent login**: Students can remain logged in across sessions, making it easier to access their dashboard quickly.

Downsides:

* **Security risks**: If a token is stolen or intercepted (e.g., in local storage), it can be used maliciously until it expires. It's essential to use secure storage (e.g., HTTP-only cookies).
* **Token size**: JWT tokens can grow large with additional payload data, which could affect performance in scenarios where they're included in every API request.
* **No built-in session revocation**: Unlike traditional sessions, where the server can invalidate a session, JWT tokens remain valid until they expire, even if a user logs out or a token is compromised.
* **Shorter lifespan**: Tokens need to expire relatively quickly for security reasons, but this could result in users needing to re-login frequently if refresh tokens arenâ€™t used effectively.

Examples:
- [jwt util](src/lib/jwt/jwt.ts)
- [graphql api route](src/app/api/graphql/route.tsx)
